Over the weekend I released this little tool called worksforme.online.

I've been struggling while making appointments with family or colleagues from different timezones to keep the time in perspective - what time is their 7pm? And although it could kind of work to make up a neat query for your favorite search program, it was bothering me that it wasn't easier to get this information.

Hence [worksforme.online](https://worksforme.online).

You can add other timezones, and easily grab a link to share with your other folks.

Let me know if you have thoughts or ideas.

(On a side note: I'm starting to really like Astro for how easy it is to get things up and running.)
