# sakr.me

This repo hosts the source code of my website (sakr.me). Discussions hold reactions and comments made to the pages (that have comments enabled.)

Ps. in light of open source, the old README is still available at SETUP.md -- it's nothing but the simple instructions of how to setup Astro up and the commands available.
